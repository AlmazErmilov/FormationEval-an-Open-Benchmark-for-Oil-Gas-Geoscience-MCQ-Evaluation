    "choices": [
      "The coarsening-upward case, because injected water preferentially moves up-dip into the least permeable layers",
      "The fining-upward case, because injected water tends to follow the more permeable basal interval and can reach the producer before sweeping tighter beds",
      "The fining-upward case, because capillary resistance is lowest in fine-grained layers and water therefore rises fastest through them",
