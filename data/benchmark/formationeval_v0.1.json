    "question": "Two structural closures sit within the same pressure compartment and are connected by a continuous permeable sandstone. One closure is shallower and structurally higher than the other. According to the chapter, what is the most likely implication for fracture-driven leakage risk?",
    "choices": [
      "The deeper closure is more likely to leak first because its overburden stress is higher",
      "The higher closure is more likely to reach fracture pressure and leak, reducing the chance that the lower closure fractures",
      "Both closures must leak at the same time because pressure is identical everywhere within a compartment",
      "Neither closure can leak because sandstones prevent pressure buildup by keeping the system hydrostatic"

    "rationale": "The chapter argues that leakage by fracturing tends to initiate at the top of the highest structure within a pressure compartment, where the intersection with fracture conditions is most easily met. If the structures communicate through a permeable carrier, the higher structure can act as a pressure relief path, making it less likely that the deeper structure reaches conditions needed to fracture and leak.",
